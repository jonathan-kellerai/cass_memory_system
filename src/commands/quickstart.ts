# cass-memory Quick Start (for Agents)

## The One Command You Need

\`\`\`bash
${cli} context "<your task>" --json
\`\`\`

Run this before starting any non-trivial task. It returns:
- **relevantBullets**: Rules that may help with your task
- **antiPatterns**: Pitfalls to avoid
- **historySnippets**: Past sessions that solved similar problems
- **suggestedCassQueries**: Searches for deeper investigation

## What You Should Expect

- **Degraded mode is normal**: If \`cass\` is missing, not indexed, or times out, context still works but history may be disabled. Run \`${cli} doctor\` and follow recommended actions.
- **Privacy by default**: Cross-agent enrichment is **opt-in and off by default**. Check with \`${cli} privacy status\`.

## What You Usually DON'T Need To Do

- Run \`${cli} reflect\` manually in a well-configured setup. An operator typically schedules it (cron/hook). If learning is stale, ask an operator to run \`${cli} reflect --days 7 --json\` regularly.
- Run \`${cli} mark\` for feedback (prefer inline comments instead)
- Manually add rules to the playbook
- Worry about the learning pipeline

The system can learn from sessions automatically **once** reflection is scheduled.

## Solo Users (You're Both Agent AND Operator)

If you're working alone without scheduled reflection:

**Option A: Manual Reflection (Recommended)**
\`\`\`bash
# After completing significant work:
${cli} reflect --days 1 --json

# Weekly maintenance:
${cli} reflect --days 7 --json
\`\`\`

**Option B: Agent-Native Onboarding**
\`\`\`bash
# Check what sessions need analysis:
${cli} onboard status --json

# Sample sessions to review:
${cli} onboard sample --json

# Read a session for rule extraction:
${cli} onboard read <session-path> --json
\`\`\`

The system works without scheduled reflection - you just trigger learning manually.

## Inline Feedback (Optional)

When a rule helps or hurts, leave a comment:

\`\`\`typescript
// [cass: helpful b-8f3a2c] - this rule saved debugging time
// [cass: harmful b-x7k9p1] - this advice was wrong for our use case
\`\`\`

These are parsed automatically during reflection.

## Protocol

1. **START**: \`${cli} context "<task>" --json\` before non-trivial work
2. **WORK**: Reference rule IDs when following them
3. **FEEDBACK**: Leave inline comments when rules help/hurt
4. **END**: Just finish. Learning happens automatically once reflection is scheduled.

> **Operator note (humans):** Schedule \`${cli} reflect --days 7 --json\` (cron/hook). Use \`${cli} doctor\` when agents report missing history or degraded mode.

## Examples

\`\`\`bash
# Before implementing auth
${cli} context "implement JWT authentication" --json

# When stuck on a bug
${cli} context "fix memory leak in connection pool" --json

# Checking for past solutions
${cli} context "optimize database queries" --json
\`\`\`

## That's It

The system is designed to be zero-friction for agents:
- ONE command to query
- Inline comments for feedback
- Everything else is automated
